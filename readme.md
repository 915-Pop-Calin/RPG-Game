Hello!  
This is the alpha version for my game which I will rename later!
I'd appreciate any feedback and any bugs you catch should be sent to my email github.rpg.bugs@gmail.com. \
Any feedback should also be sent there! Thank you for taking your time! \

In order to play the game, you must have the following installed:  
The newest Python version  
termcolor package  
random package  
math package  
In order to run it, open a command prompt in the cloned repo and just write py main.py
