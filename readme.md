Hello!  
This is the alpha version for my game which I will rename later!
I'd appreciate any feedback and any bugs you catch should be sent to my email github.rpg.bugs@gmail.com. \
Any feedback should also be sent there! Thank you for taking your time! \

In order to play the game, you must have the following installed:  
The newest Python version  (3.9+)
termcolor package   
texttable package  
In order to run it, open a command prompt in the cloned repo and just write py main.py
It is highly recommended to use git bash as a command prompt in order for both packages to work properly  
Here you can download git bash: https://git-scm.com/downloads  
If you feel generous and like the game and want me to work more on it (add more items and more bosses), here's my PayPal: paypal.me/calinpop32.
